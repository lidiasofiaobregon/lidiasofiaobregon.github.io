# 25 Grad School Decision Making Variables For You to Consider

**Explanation:** My brain has this... *interesting* feature where it "has" to collect mass amounts of information before making a decision. The more severe and important the decision, the more data. This can be quite painful for me (in some instances) but it can also serve as a magnet for data collection. Thus, instead of wallowing in self-pity as I usually do, I've chosen to aggregate the data I've collected for you and have a little fun with it. I present to you : ***25 Grad School Decision Making Variables for you to Consider***. During my PhD selection process, I collected a host of different opinions, advice, wisdom, and experiences related to the decision-making process. I've boiled this all down to 25 variables I think are important for making a decision on which graduate school to attend. With this being said, I recommend doing yourself a favor and selecting a subset of these variables that are important to YOU (i.e. 5-8 of them) and focusing on those, so as to not overwhelm your brain when making a decision. Taking all 25 into considertation may or may not cause spontaneous combustion. I hope this helps! Happy deciding!
